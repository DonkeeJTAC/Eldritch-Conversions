# Day 1: 9 July 2024: Mission and Vision- 

# Eldritch-Conversions will be an application that is built with modularity in mind. 
# It aims to solve the age old TTRPG and system issues when chossing to play multiple systems or looking to convert from one system to a new system. 
# 2024 marks the 50 year anniversary for the eldest TTRPG on planet earth.
# In the last 50 years there has been some great adventures released. The issue is that a majority of these adventureas are not compatiable with the rule sets of todays games. 
# This leaves players with two choices. Play older versions of the rules, or a game master spends time converting past adventures to todays rule sets. Eldritch conversions will shorten that chain!

# Eldritch-Conversions will be developed in two seperate pipes. The first conversion program to be developed will convert Monsters and NPC's from a game system of choice to another game system of choice. 
# The second pipe will be an application that can convert player character. The plan is that once both independent pipes are functional they will be merged into a single usable applicaiton.
# Common game systems that will be implemented are listed:
  # 5e
  # 3.x
  # PF2E
  # DCC
  # AD&D
  # 4th Edition (Gross)
  # Future Systems as they are mature/user requests
# You may be emotionally attached to your 7ft tall Goliath Rogue Thief named Tiny, or your Lizardfolk Bard that suffers from a terrible lysp and casts wild magic like a Sorcerer with each "hisssssssss". 
# You don't want to stop using these player characters just because you are gaming with friends that use a different system. 
# Eldritch Conversions aims to bridge these gaps and make your characters, monsters and adventures system agnostic. 
# Why be stuck funding a single company or small bucket of companies just becuase they write the adventures for your chosen system?
# With Eldrich Conversions you can pick the adventures that are fun and the setting that appeals to you. Don't be stuck with a single publisher or in one gaming era anymore. 
# Convert what you want to play. Play what is fun, that's why we play the game.
